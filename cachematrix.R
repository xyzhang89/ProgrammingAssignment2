##Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be
##some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly.
##This assignment is to write a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.

##This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse, 
##which is really a list containing a function to
##1. set the value of the matrix
##2. get the value of the matrix
##3. set the value of the inverse
##4. get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    inv <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        inv <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setinv <- function(matrix) inv <<- matrix
    getinv <- function() inv
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setinv = setinv,
         getinv = getinv)
    
}

## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the 
## cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
    inv <- x$getinv()
    if(!is.null(inv)) {
        message("getting cached data")
        return(inv)
    }
    message("calculating inverse of matrix")
    data <- x$get()
    inv <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setinv(inv)
    inv
}
