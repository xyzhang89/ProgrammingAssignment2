##Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be
##some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly.
##This assignment is to write a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.

##This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    m <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        m <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setmatrix <- function(matrix) m <<- matrix
    getmatrix <- function() m
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setmatrix = setmatrix,
         getmatrix = getmatrix)
    
}

## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the 
## cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
    m <- x$getmatrix()
    if(!is.null(m)) {
        message("getting cached data")
        return(m)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    m <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setmatrix(m)
    m
}
